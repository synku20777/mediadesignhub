        Bringing psychology and technology together is at the heart of UX design
        because UX is people. However, you do not need a degree in psychology to
        understand the basics of how humans function. Most psychological
        principles that are relevant to UX are easy to understand but make a big
        difference when applied correctly.

          <h3>Peak-End Rule</h3>
          <p>
            People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its
            peak and at its end, rather than the total sum or average of every
            moment of the experience.

Below this, in large text, it says 'High Five!'' followed by the message 'Web Field Manual Dispatch No.159 will go out shortly' It indicates that the campaign will be sent to 1,373 subscribers from the audience 'Web Field Manual Dispatch.' There's also a link provided to view or share the campaign, along with a suggestion to 'Track Performance on Our Mobile App."

            A 1993 study titled “When More Pain Is Preferred to Less: Adding a
            Better End” by Kahneman, Fredrickson, Charles Schreiber, and Donald
            Redelmeier provided groundbreaking evidence for the peak-end rule.
            Participants were subjected to two different versions of a single
            unpleasant experience. The first trial had subjects submerge a hand
            in 14°C water for 60 seconds. The second trial had subjects submerge
            the other hand in 14°C water for 60 seconds, but then keep their
            hand submerged for an additional 30 seconds, during which the
            temperature was raised to 15 °C. Subjects were then offered the
            option of which trial to repeat. Against the law of temporal
            monotonicity, subjects were more willing to repeat the second trial,
            despite a prolonged exposure to uncomfortable temperatures. Kahneman
            et al. concluded that “subjects chose the long trial simply because
            they liked the memory of it better than the alternative (or disliked
            it less)”.

          <h3>Aesthetic-Usability Effect</h3>
          <p>
            Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that's
            more usable.

      The image shows a website page advertising a product named Zip,described as a wireless activity tracker. In the center, there's a large, bright pink Zip tracker with the Fitbit logo. The background is a photo of two young children playing hopscotch on pavement; the hopscotch grid is drawn with chalk. One child, a girl in a blue dress and white shoes, is standing still, while a boy in a dark blue sweater and jeans appears to be in motion as if hopping. An adult woman is partially visible to the right, wearing a striped blue and white shirt with dark pants, and purple shoes. Text on the page includes The tracker that hides while you seek, and options like Features, App+Dashboard,Gallery, Specs, and a Buy Now button with the price $59.95."

            The aesthetic-usability effect was first studied in the field of
            human-computer interaction in 1995. Researchers Masaaki Kurosu and
            Kaori Kashimura from the Hitachi Design Center tested 26 variations
            of an ATM UI, asking the 252 study participants to rate each design
            on ease of use, as well as aesthetic appeal. They found a stronger
            correlation between the participants' ratings of aesthetic appeal
            and perceived ease of use than the correlation between their ratings
            of aesthetic appeal and actual ease of use. Kurosu and Kashimura
            concluded that users are strongly influenced by the aesthetics of
            any given interface, even when they try to evaluate the underlying
            functionality of the system.

            The image is a split-screen comparison of two web pages, both from Bloomberg. The layout of both pages is nearly identical, featuring the Bloomberg logo at the top, followed by a main news story with a photograph and headline that reads 'Saudis Pledge Decisive Oil Supply Boost to Comfort Consumers.'' The photograph shows a man in traditional Saudi attire at an oil facility. Below the main story are smaller news items with headlines about various economic topics. The web pages have a navigation bar with options like 'Home,' 'Markets,'' 'Technology,'' 'Politics,'' and more. The purpose of the comparison is not clear from the description, but there may be subtle differences in content or layout."

            In 1956, George Miller asserted that the span of immediate memory
            and absolute judgment were both limited to around 7 pieces of
            information. The main unit of information is the bit, the amount of
            data necessary to make a choice between two equally likely
            alternatives. Likewise, 4 bits of information is a decision between
            16 binary alternatives (4 successive binary decisions). The point
            where confusion creates an incorrect judgment is the channel
            capacity. In other words, the quantity of bits which can be
            transmitted reliably through a channel, within a certain amount of
            time.

            Hick's Law (or the Hick-Hyman Law) is named after a British and an
            American psychologist team of William Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman. In
            1952, this pair set out to examine the relationship between the
            number of stimuli present and an individuals reaction time to any
            given stimulus. As you would expect, the more stimuli to choose
            from, the longer it takes the user to make a decision on which one
            to interact with. Users bombarded with choices have to take time to
            interpret and decide, giving them work they don't want. Source
